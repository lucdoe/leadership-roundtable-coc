            <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8">
                Welcome to the Community Guidelines of the Leadership Roundtables Slack group. As we bring our local
                community online, we want to ensure a comfortable and inclusive space for everyone. Below are our
                instructions for navigating the community and our Code of Conduct.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">How to join?</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
                The Leadership Roundtables community is for … <span class="text-orange-400">(JC definition here)</span>.
                While steadily expanding, we have
                chosen to mainly hand out invites at our in-person meetings. Nevertheless, if you missed the opportunity
                during an event or have a friend who would like to get involved, don’t hesitate to reach out to one of
                our <a href="#drivers" class="underline text-[#6664F1]">drivers</a>!
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
                The Code of Conduct closely follows the values of the organisers and Netlight as a whole. To start off
                with, it is worth mentioning that the below applies <b>both online and offline</b>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-8 text-xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-700">Knowledge Sharing</h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg">At its core, our community follows the so-called <a
                    href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule"
                    class="text-[#6664F1] underline hover:text-[#7675cd]">Chatham House
                    Rule</a>. In other words, *share the information you
                receive, but do not reveal the identity of who said it.* As defined by Chatham House themselves, the
                rule reads as follows:</p>
            <figure class="mt-6 border-l border-[#6664F1] pl-9">
                <blockquote class="font-semibold text-gray-900">
                    <p class="text-lg">
                        “When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to
                        use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s),
                        nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.”
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption class="mt-4 flex gap-x-4">
                    <p class="text-sm leading-6">
                        Chatham House Rule
                    </p>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p class="mt-6 text-lg">This rule may seem self-explanatory, but we believe it is worth mentioning. We want
                to
                cultivate a safe
                and comfortable community for all participants while encouraging knowledge-sharing and mutual growth.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-8 text-xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-700">Zero tolerance for inappropriate behaviour
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg">The Leadership Roundtable community has a zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of
                discrimination, harassment, degrading treatment and retaliation. We define these types of behaviours as…
                <span class="text-orange-400">(Is there a resource?)</span>. To prevent and stop such behaviour, we
                advise all community members always to be
                mindful of everyone’s privacy and psychological safety. In other words, our community environment shall
                be characterised by openness, respect and equality. <br />
                If you encounter any kind of inappropriate behaviour, be it towards yourself or a third party, please
                reach out to one of our <a href="#drivers" class="underline text-[#6664F1]">drivers</a>. We will always
                respect confidentiality requests to
                protect victims of abuse. <br /><br />
                Breaches of our zero-tolerance policy are unacceptable and will result in removal from future events and
                the Slack community. <span class="text-orange-400">(Feedback from JC here about how you would like to
                    approach this section)</span>
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Encouragement and Mentorship <span
                    class="text-orange-400 text-sm">(JC is this aligned with what the community is about?)</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg">As the Leadership Roundtable community, we believe in the power of mentorship and
                positively
                inspiring each other. We are committed to fostering an environment where all members, regardless of
                their experience level, background, or identity, feel valued and supported to grow. Every community
                member is encouraged to seek mentoring opportunities as mentors or mentees and learn from each other's
                experiences and perspectives. Our community thrives when we share knowledge openly, support one
                another's growth and act as positive role models.</p>

            <h2 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Advertising & Recruiting
            </h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-lg">We are more than happy for our community members to advertise their own events,
                recruit
                their fellow peers, or use the community in any other way for each other’s mutual benefit. However, we
                ask members to exercise a modicum of discretion and care in doing so. After all, we aim to cultivate our
                local communities around knowledge sharing and peer-to-peer support rather than an advertising platform.
                Therefore, the drivers reserve the right to direct such communication to specified Slack channels or
                remove unwanted content altogether.</p>
